# Operators Lab

## Prerequisites
You are expected to review the `Working with Basic Operators` written lecture prior to working on this lab. If you are not familiar with the concepts being explored in the lab, please make sure to review the study material first.

## Description
In this exercise, you will practice using comparison operators and logical operators.

Logical operators can be combined just like having multiple mathematical operators in a math equation. Like math equations, they can be combined using parentheses, where the parentheses are completed first. 

Write your logic without using any if or conditional statements - that is, you should only use &&, ||, !, == for the more complex operations. All of these problems can be solved in a single line.

## Completing the Lab
You will be editing the `Comparisons.java`, `Booleans.java`, and `BooleansAdvanced.java` files. These files can be found under the `src/main/java` package. Review each file's code and code comments for further instructions.

Tasks to complete within the `Comparisons.java` file:
- [ ] Revise the return statement of the method named `isEqual` so that it uses a comparison operator to return the correct result.
- [ ] Revise the return statement of the method named `isGreaterThan` so that it uses a comparison operator to return the correct result.
- [ ] Revise the return statement of the method named `isLessThan` so that it uses a comparison operator to return the correct result.
- [ ] Revise the return statement of the method named `isGreaterThanOrEqualTo` so that it uses a comparison operator to return the correct result.
- [ ] Revise the return statement of the method named `isLessThanOrEqualTo` so that it uses a comparison operator to return the correct result.
- [ ] Revise the return statement of the method named `isNotEqualTo` so that it uses a comparison operator to return the correct result.

Tasks to complete within the `Booleans.java` file:
- [ ] Revise the return statement of the method named `returnBoolean` so that it uses a boolean operator to return the correct result.
- [ ] Revise the return statement of the method named `returnNot` so that it uses a boolean operator to return the correct result.
- [ ] Revise the return statement of the method named `returnAnd` so that it uses a boolean operator to return the correct result.
- [ ] Revise the return statement of the method named `returnOr` so that it uses a boolean operator to return the correct result.

Tasks to complete within the `BooleansAdvanced.java` file:
- [ ] Revise the return statement of the method named `returnNotBoth` so that it uses a boolean operator to return the correct result.
- [ ] Revise the return statement of the method named `returnExclusiveOr` so that it uses a boolean operator to return the correct result.
- [ ] Revise the return statement of the method named `returnNeitherNor` so that it uses a boolean operator to return the correct result.

## Running Tests
The `src/test/java` folder will contain your test files.  

To run the tests, click on the Testing tab (test beaker icon on the left-hand side) and run the test cases by using the "Run Test" button (play icon). Please ensure that you do not already have the program running.

You can optionally run the program for manual testing by switching to the file named `Main.java` under the `src/main/java` package and clicking the "Run Java" button (play icon) on the top-right of VSCode.
